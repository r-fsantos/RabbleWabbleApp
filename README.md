# RabbleWabbleApp

Project for learning different design patterns applied to iOS Apps.

## MVC

- Located at `mvc` branch. Uses storyboards.

- "Considered" an architectural/structural pattern.

### Key points

- Separates architecture into:
  - Models (data abstraction)
  - Views (presentation layer | UI / UX)
  - Controllers (business core logic between models and views)
- Great start point, but as business rule become more complex, another structures can arise to enable
a scalable App structure
